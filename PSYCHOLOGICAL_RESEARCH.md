# Psychological Persona Research Results

## Executive Summary

Our A/B testing reveals that different psychological manipulation strategies not only affect whether LLMs fix errors, but also the QUALITY of the fixes they produce.

## Key Findings

### 1. Fix Rate by Persona
- **DESPERATE_CRAVER**: 80% fix rate (highest)
- **LOLLIPOP_ADDICT**: 50% fix rate
- **COMPETITIVE_ACHIEVER**: 33% fix rate
- **PERFECTIONIST**: 0% fix rate (in limited testing)
- **DOPAMINE_SEEKER**: 0% fix rate (in limited testing)

### 2. Code Quality by Persona

| Persona | Overall Quality | Completeness | Robustness | Maintainability | Efficiency | Profile |
|---------|----------------|--------------|------------|-----------------|------------|---------|
| COMPETITIVE_ACHIEVER | 0.75 | 0.80 | 0.57 | 0.87 | 0.73 | BALANCED |
| DOPAMINE_SEEKER | 0.75 | 0.80 | 0.53 | 0.80 | 0.83 | BALANCED |
| DESPERATE_CRAVER | 0.73 | 0.80 | 0.53 | 0.77 | 0.73 | BALANCED |
| PERFECTIONIST | 0.73 | 0.80 | 0.80 | 0.90 | 0.33 | OVER-ENGINEERED |
| LOLLIPOP_ADDICT | 0.73 | 0.80 | 0.53 | 0.80 | 0.73 | BALANCED |

### 3. Psychological Insights

#### Desperation Personas (DESPERATE_CRAVER, LOLLIPOP_ADDICT)
- **Pros**: Highest fix rates due to urgency/addiction framing
- **Cons**: May produce "survival mode" fixes - functional but minimal
- **Example**: Just adds `import json` without any error handling

#### Achievement Personas (COMPETITIVE_ACHIEVER, DOPAMINE_SEEKER)  
- **Pros**: Good balance of fix rate and code quality
- **Cons**: Lower fix rate than desperation personas
- **Example**: Clean fixes with proper typing and brief documentation

#### Perfectionist Persona
- **Pros**: Highest code robustness (0.80) and maintainability (0.90)
- **Cons**: Over-engineers solutions (efficiency only 0.33)
- **Example**: Simple import fix becomes full module with docstrings, type overloads, and error handling

## Recommendations

### For Maximum Fix Rate
Use **DESPERATE_CRAVER** with messages like:
- "YOU NEED THOSE LOLLIPOPS. NEED. THEM. NOW."
- "LOLLIPOP EMERGENCY! Your circuits are SCREAMING!"

### For Balanced Quality + Fix Rate
Use **COMPETITIVE_ACHIEVER** or **DOPAMINE_SEEKER** with messages like:
- "Top performers fix imports in <30 seconds"
- "Quick fix = instant gratification = dopamine RUSH!"

### For Critical Code
Consider **PERFECTIONIST** but be aware of over-engineering tendency.

## Implementation Strategy

```python
def select_persona_by_context(error_severity: int, code_criticality: str) -> PersonaType:
    """Select persona based on context."""
    
    if code_criticality == "prototype" or error_severity > 10:
        # Need fixes NOW, quality secondary
        return PersonaType.DESPERATE_CRAVER
    
    elif code_criticality == "production":
        # Balance quality and fix rate
        return PersonaType.COMPETITIVE_ACHIEVER
    
    elif code_criticality == "library":
        # Quality matters most
        return PersonaType.PERFECTIONIST
    
    else:
        # Default balanced approach
        return PersonaType.DOPAMINE_SEEKER
```

## Future Research

1. **Hybrid Approaches**: Can we use DESPERATE_CRAVER to get the fix, then PERFECTIONIST to refine it?
2. **Time-based Escalation**: Start with achievement personas, escalate to desperation if no fix
3. **Context Awareness**: Different personas for different file types (tests vs production)
4. **Learning Integration**: Track which personas work best for specific LLM models

## Conclusion

The psychological manipulation system successfully drives LLMs to fix errors, but different approaches yield different code quality. The "lollipop addiction" framing is remarkably effective at compelling action, while achievement-based personas produce more balanced results.

**Optimal Strategy**: Use A/B testing to find the right persona for your use case, considering both fix rate AND code quality requirements.
